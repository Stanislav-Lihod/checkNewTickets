Check new Tickets on Georgian Railway

Due to the frequent lack of tickets on the Georgian railway. I wrote a script that will check every 5 seconds for tickets, and if cheap tickets are found, it stops working and notifies me with a sound.
If a ticket is found but it's expensive, the script does not stop but it makes a different sound to attract me.

Written checks to ensure that the script does not make sounds with each update on an expensive ticket
